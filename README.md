## How do I play this game?
- You move the player with your keyboard arrows, left, right, up and down
- The enemies move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the game board
- If you collide with an enemy, the game is reset and your player character moves back to the starting square
- How do I win? Once you reach the water (i.e., the top of the game board), then you have won the game.
